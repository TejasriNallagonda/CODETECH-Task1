OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
PROJECT:WEATHER FORECAST APP

OBJECTIVE:
The primary objective of the Weather Forecast App is to provide users with real-time weather information for a specific location. The app allows users to search for weather details by entering a city name, and it displays essential weather data such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and wind speed. The app fetches live data from a weather API and updates dynamically based on user input.

Key Features:
City Search: Allows users to enter a city name to get weather details.
Real-time Weather Data: Displays current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and more.
Error Handling: If the city is not found or there is a network issue, the app alerts the user.
Responsive Design: The app adjusts its layout to different screen sizes for a mobile-friendly experience.
Weather Icons: Optional feature to show relevant weather icons based on the conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.).
Unit Options (optional): Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units for temperature.
Clear UI/UX: A clean interface that presents weather information in a simple, readable format.

Technologies Used:
HTML5:
Used to structure the app's content, including text fields for input, buttons, and sections to display weather data.

CSS3:
Used for styling the weather app, making it visually appealing and responsive across different devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
CSS Flexbox/Grid for layout and positioning.
Media queries for responsiveness to adjust the layout for mobile screens.

JavaScript:
Fetch API / Axios: Used for sending asynchronous HTTP requests to get weather data from an external weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
DOM Manipulation: For dynamically updating the content (temperature, humidity, etc.) based on the fetched data.
Event Handling: To capture user inputs (city search) and interact with the weather API.

Weather API:
OpenWeatherMap API or similar weather APIs (e.g., WeatherAPI, AccuWeather) to fetch real-time weather data for any given city.
JSON format to structure the API response.

Optional Technologies (for added features):
Weather Icons API (e.g., Weather Icons): To show weather icons representing different weather conditions like sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.
Local Storage: To save the last searched city or preferences (e.g., temperature units) in the browser.

Project Summary:
This Weather Forecast App allows users to check live weather information for any city they search for. By utilizing modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with an external weather API, the app provides users with up-to-date, accurate weather data in a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
